# ============================================================================
# NewsBot - Keyword & Relevance Configuration
# ============================================================================
# The bot uses a TWO-LAYER filtering approach:
#
# Layer 1 - Primary Keywords: Article must contain at least one of these.
# Layer 2 - Context Keywords: Article must ALSO contain at least one context
#           keyword to prove it's actually about defence/sovereignty topics
#           (not just a random mention of "supply chain" in an unrelated article).
#
# Scoring: title matches count 3x more than description matches.
# An article needs a minimum relevance_score to be included.
# ============================================================================
